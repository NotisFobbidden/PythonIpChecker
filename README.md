It gives you quite a lot of info about the ip adress, such as [Country, City, Time zone]

It also uses nmap to check ports and returns the open ones.

[WARNING] When clicking the button, the app may freeze for few seconds. It occurs because nmap is getting and returning data. 
Please, be patient, the app resumes it's work after (2-7) secods. It depends on how much ports you check.
